Rating agencies, analysts, and central banks are pointing to stronger-than-expected momentum in some major economies, easing trade tensions, and improved inflation dynamics. But these positive signs come with significant caveats: risks from US slowdown, trade policy uncertainty, inflation persistence, and external shocks remain potent.\n\n---\n\n## What the New Forecasts Say\n\n**Global GDP Growth Raised**  \nFitch recently revised its 2025 global GDP growth forecast upwards to ≈ **2.4%**, from earlier projections of ~2.2%. A key factor here is better-than-expected performance from China and the Eurozone.\n\n**Major Economies: Mixed Signals**\n\n- **India**: ~6.5% (prev) → **6.9% FY26**. Drivers: strong Q2 (~7.8% YoY), resilient demand, real income gains, easier finance.\n- **China & Eurozone**: Upgraded to ~4.2% (China) and ~0.8% (Eurozone) as inflation eases and demand improves.\n- **US**: Forecast ~1.5% in 2025, but risks from weaker consumption in 2H25.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Supporting the Upgrades\n\n- **Domestic demand strength** in India, Europe.\n- **Trade/policy easing** lifting sentiment.\n- **Monetary policy signals** of cuts in some regions.\n\n---\n\n## Risks and Warning Signs\n\n- **US slowdown** → weaker global demand.\n- **Trade & policy uncertainty** → tariffs, supply chains at risk.\n- **Inflation persistence** (sticky core inflation, energy shocks).\n- **Monetary lag effects** from past rate hikes.\n- **Geopolitical shocks**: sanctions, commodity supply, EM currency crises.\n\n---\n\n## Implications\n\n**Winners**: India (6.9% FY26), Eurozone, China.  \n**Risk-bearers**: US (fragile 1.5% growth), debt-heavy EM, commodity-dependent exporters.\n\n---\n\n## Snapshot Data\n\n| Metric                  | Forecast | Notes |\n|-------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Global GDP 2025         | ~2.4%    | Up from ~2.2% |\n| US growth 2025          | ~1.5%    | Slightly higher, fragile |\n| India FY26              | 6.9%     | Up from 6.5% |\n| China 2025              | ~4.2%    | Up from 3.9% |\n| Eurozone 2025           | ~0.8%    | Up from 0.6% |\n\n---\n\n## Policy Implications\n\n- Inflation & rates: sticky → possible stall in cuts.\n- Trade/tariffs: diversify supply chains.\n- EM risk: need buffers against capital outflows.\n- Domestic demand: stronger resilience than exports.\n- Scenario planning: hedge oil/tariff shocks.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUpward revisions are encouraging but fragile. Optimism is concentrated in India, China, Eurozone; risks remain heavy in US and vulnerable EMs. Policy responses in coming quarters will decide whether the upgrades last."
